# Motivation and Research Question

## Growing Risks of Natural Disasters

* Climate change implies more frequent and more damaging disasters [@van2006impacts]
* Disasters do not discriminate with respect to wealth, but institutions and wealth helps mitigate deaths [@kahn2005death]
* Growing fiscal and social costs within the United States
    * More frequent FEMA disaster declarations
    * Higher federal costs for declared disasters
    * Non-disaster government transfers increases may understate true cost [@deryugina2016fiscal]

## Out of the Frying Pan?

* Some evidence that people move after big disasters
    * @boustan2017effect
    * @carleton2016social
* Rational actors respond to disasters by moving to new locations
    * Because their homes are destroyed?
    * Because the local economy is harmed?
    * Because they have updated their priors about risks?
* Move people out of dangerous areas, but does this lower future disaster costs?
* All else equal, higher exposure areas should see lower migration rates


## And Into the Fire?

* Disaster exposure is spatially correlated
* Disasters are negative income shocks and long moves are costly
* People tend to move relatively short distances
* If disasters induce shorter moves, migration may not lower future disaster costs
* **Shorter moves may not lower costs**
    * **Key question**: where do disaster migrants locate to?
    * And does migration mitigate impacts of disasters or simply rearrange the deck chairs?


# Hurricane Katrina

## Impacts

* Category 3 Hurricane at landing (sustained winds of 100â€“140 miles per hour)
* Landed 25 August 2005 in Louisiana
* Total damage estimated at \$108 billion [@knobb2005tropical]
* Deaths appear to be at least 1,500 [@beven2008atlantic]
* Triggered response of over \$5.7 billion in FEMA disaster relief

## How Did Katrina Affect New Orleans Migrants?

* Data from IRS county-to-county migration used, tracks filed tax returns at FIPS code from year to year
* Typical outmigration from New Orleans area from 2000 to 2010 excluding 2005 averaged `r prettyNum(round(sum(hurricane$exmpt_katrina[hurricane$year > 1999 & hurricane$year < 2011 & hurricane$year != 2005], na.rm = T)/10), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` outmigrants per year (average population of `r prettyNum(round(sum(hurricane$tot_pop[hurricane$year > 1999 & hurricane$year < 2011 & hurricane$year != 2005 & (hurricane$fips %in%katrina)], na.rm = T)/10), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)`)
    * Parishes - Jefferson, Lafourche, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. John the Baptist, and St. Tammany, and Terrebonne
    * Fairly stable spatial distribution - nearby and large metro regions
* In 2005, total of `r prettyNum(round(sum(hurricane$exmpt_katrina[hurricane$year == 2005], na.rm = T)), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` outmigrants
    * Similar spatial pattern exists plus evident overflow

# Empirical Strategy


## Gravity Model

Beginings from Newtonian physics, which imply

$$ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$

Princeton Astronomer James Q. Stewart observed the composition of students in his classroom [@stewart1941inverse]:

$$ M_{ij} = k \frac{P_{i}^{\beta_1} P_{j}^{\beta_2}}{D_{ij}^{\gamma}} $$


## Modified

For outmigration from Katrina affected areas:

$$ m_{i,t} = \alpha + \gamma D_{i} + \beta_1 P_{i,t} + \beta_2 {Katrina} + \beta_3 \mathbf{X_{i,t}} + \varepsilon_{i,t}$$ 

* $i$ indicates county destination and $t$ indicates year
* $m$ is migration measure
    * Raw flow, inverse hyperbolic sine, share of outflow, and indicator of positive migration
* $D$ indicates distance from centroid of affected area
* $P$ is the population for destination county
* ${Katrina}$ is dummy variable for 2005
* $\mathbf{X_{i,t}}$ are economic characteristics: unemployment rate, median rent, average pay


## Modified

Model entails destination's distance from New Orleans, its population, a Katrina indicator for 2005, and economic indicators.

* Panel of migration outflow from affected counties from 2000 to 2010
* Start with baseline model of New Orleans area destinations 
* Interact explanatory variables with Katrina variable
* Attribute change in effects to the disaster response

# Conclusion


## A role for policy

* Katrina's impact on outmigration increased the outflows in both volume and breadth, but the distribution of appears unaffected
* Katrina disaster migrants do not migrate as far from New Orleans than in non-disaster years and destination population became less important
* Economic variables indicate mixed results with respect to migration decision of Katrina migrants
* Migration decisions do not appear to mitigate risk as measured via distance
* Data limitations constrain the ability to determine the degree to which migrants return to New Orleans
